# Scouting App
 Scouting app for CPR3663

 Our scouting app uses coordinate-based time-stamped events to capture scouting data for each team.  This differs from most other teams that (only) do a "tally" approach.  Our methodology enables us to view Auto paths from teams, understand preferred starting positions, paths of travel, etc.  Because we also capture time-based data, we can understand cycle times and how that is affected when being defended or other scenarios.
